# **Book Review Genre Classifier**

This project is a machine learning model that classifies book reviews into specific genres. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques
to analyze review text and assign a genre based on keywords and content. The project follows a full NLP pipeline, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training and evaluation.

# **ðŸš€Project Plan and MethodologyðŸš€**

The core of this project is to use the Review column as the feature and create a new Genre column as the label. The classification is performed by:

**Genre Assignment:** A dictionary of common words is created for seven genres: romance, sci-fi, historical, fantasy, children, thriller, and adventure. Each review is then assigned a genre based on which set of keywords it contains the most.

**Text Preprocessing:** The Review text is preprocessed by tokenizing, converting to lowercase, and removing punctuation and stop words using the gensim.utils.simple_preprocess function.

**Feature Engineering:** The preprocessed text is transformed into numerical features using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer.

**Model Training and Evaluation:** Four different machine learning models are trained and evaluated using a grid search to find the best hyperparameters:

  - Logistic Regression

  - Random Forest Classifier

  - Decision Tree Classifier

  - Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBDT)

**Performance Metrics:** Model performance is evaluated using both accuracy and balanced accuracy scores, the latter being particularly useful for imbalanced datasets.

# **ðŸ§©Technologies and LibrariesðŸ§©**
**Pandas:** Used for data manipulation, including loading the dataset and creating new columns.

**NumPy:** Used for numerical operations.

**Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Used for data visualization and exploration.

**scikit-learn:** A comprehensive library for machine learning, used for model training (LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier), model selection (GridSearchCV), and performance metrics (accuracy_score, balanced_accuracy_score, confusion_matrix).

**Gensim:** Used for text preprocessing and tokenization.

How to Run the Project
Ensure you have Python installed.

Install the required libraries. The notebook uses pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, gensim, and nltk. You can install them with pip:

```
  Bash
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn gensim nltk
```
Place the BookReviewsDataSet.csv file in a data directory within the project's root folder.
Open and run the BookReviewGenreClassifier.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. The notebook contains all the code cells for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
